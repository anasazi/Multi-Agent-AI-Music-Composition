\section{Analysis of Generated Music}

\subsection{Variety} 
% no repeats, detectable difference in both audio and theory 
While deterministic AIs are useful in some contexts, variety is preferred in music composition.
Even though the first species implementation uses a non-deterministic generator, it does not follow that the system as a whole is non-deterministic.
If the rules are constraining enough, only a single result could be acceptable.
Fortunately, this does not turn out to be the case.
In testing with a single \emph{cantus firmus}, the system has never repeated a composition and has generated 32 unique compositions.
More importantly, these compositions are noticeably different when played, even to non-experts.
While entirely possible for the system to generate duplicates, it appears to be a rare event.

\subsection{Quality} 
% always finds something without violations eventually. more regular than human composed music. 
The 32 compositions discussed in the previously, in addition to being unique, made no rule violations.
That is, in every test, the system found a composition that was ``perfect'' from the perspective of first species counterpoint.
Compared to the human composition using the same \emph{cantus firmus}, several of the AI compositions sound more regular or repetitive.
Overall, the AI compositions are certainly recognizable as music and comparable with human composed equivalents, but a listener can usually differentiate between the two.

\subsection{Emergent Complexity} 
% chord progressions 
While some of the counterpoint rules deal with whole-composition properties, 
such as the ratio of skips and steps, all rules regulating structure work on a local area.
There is no conception of a whole-composition structure such as progression or cadence.
However, a noticeable property of the AI compositions is the common presence of recognizable chord progressions.
These progressions give the AI compositions a sense of structure and contribute significantly to the quality.
The common chord progressions, such as IV-V-I, appear often throughout the AI compositions.
More complex progressions, such as V-vi-IV-I, appear as well.
The presence of these progressions implies that they arise naturally from the combination of rules in first species counterpoint.

\subsection{Composition Speed} 
% fast 
% TODO write
% TODO maybe make a graph/histogram/stats of composition speeds
