\section{Analysis of Generated Music}

\subsection{Variety} 
% no repeats, detectable difference in both audio and theory 
% TODO write
While deterministic AIs are useful in some contexts, variety is preferred in music composition.
Even though the first species implementation uses a non-deterministic generator, it does not follow that the system as a whole is non-deterministic.
If the rules are constraining enough, only a single result could be acceptable.
Fortunately, this does not turn out to be the case.
In testing with a single \emph{cantus firmus}, the system has never repeated a composition and has generated 32 unique compositions.
More importantly, these compositions are noticeably different when played, even to non-experts.
While entirely possible for the system to generate duplicates, it appears to be a rare event.

\subsection{Quality} 
% always finds something without violations eventually. more regular than human composed music.

\subsection{Composition Speed} 
% fast 
% TODO write
% TODO maybe make a graph/histogram/stats of composition speeds
