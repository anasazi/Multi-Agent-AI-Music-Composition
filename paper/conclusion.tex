\section{Conclusion}

Overall, the multi-agent blackboard approach worked well.
The agents implemented for first species counterpoint are all rather simple, but blackboard framework supports making agents as complicated as necessary.
Even though our agents were simple, emergent structure appeared as chord progressions.
From the music theory perspective, the compositions were fantastic.
From the human listener perspective, there were several areas for improvement, 
but these could possibly be handled by some sophisticated agents that deal with more complex musical concepts like tension and progression.
Implemented rules as independent agents makes it very easy swap rules in and out, which enables easy experimentation on the effects of various rules.
This is useful for music theory education, experimental music using new rules, and as a testbed to see if a potential model of a genre is correct.
